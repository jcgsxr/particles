3D Particles
================

Intro
-----
This project demonstrates various 3D particle effects, as well as pause and rewind features for certain effects. 
Since not much of the code has been modified for a long time, it's not super clean, nor is it very modern. 

All code was written by myself, and most of it is written in C++ (before I became comfortable in Objective-C). Along with the visual particle effects, profiling info is also made visible, such as the number of polys being rendered at any time, and the resulting fps.




Examples
--------

Tap and drag to rotate around the particles, pinch to zoom. The buttons on the right-hand side allow for reversing or pausing time.

A regular 2D effect, nothing special :)

Chaining particles together gives a string-type effect.

Using a gravity well of sorts, the particles will circle around continuously.
